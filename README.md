# Mini Project Code

This repositary consist of the Driver side as well as the user side app of the mini project we worked on

## Overview

We built this app to aid the users in knowing the current location of the bus drivers and with respect to the location of the users. This eleminates the need for users to keep a constant communication with drivers or conductors in buses. By adding a Incident Report section the bus drivers as well as the users can report there incident which will be saved in our firestore database

P.S this does contain a few unnessary files which are not implemented and arent in need for running the app
